# AQI Prediction with Hyperparameter Tuning

This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using a deep learning model to assess pollution levels and potential health risks. By analyzing historical data and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and pollutant concentrations, the model provides accurate AQI forecasts.

+ **Key Features**
  
  + Dynamic Model Architecture: The neural network structure is dynamically configured, allowing the number of layers and units per layer to be tuned for optimal performance.
    
  + Hyperparameter Tuning: Random Search explores multiple hyperparameter combinations with up to 5 trials and 3 executions per trial, ensuring robust results.
    
  + Comprehensive Data Analysis: Historical AQI data and environmental variables are preprocessed and normalized for efficient model training.

+ **Technologies Used**
  
  + Python – Scripting and data manipulation
  + TensorFlow & Keras – Deep learning framework for model building
  + Keras Tuner – Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model configuration
  + NumPy & Pandas – Data preprocessing and handling
    
+ **Results**
  
Achieved reliable AQI predictions with mean absolute error below 1.5 Optimal hyperparameter combinations significantly improved model accuracy and stability.
